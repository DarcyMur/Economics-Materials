Why can economics be referred to as the study of trade-offs?	Because a fundimental issue within economics is that there are only a scare and finite number of resources which can be used to satisfy unlimited and competing wants. Due to this, some wants must be forgone. Therefore, to not fulfil one want is a trade-off of not fulfilling another.	Econ::Term::1::Week_1

On the advent of Kidney Dialysis Machines there was a scarce few, and therefore only a few people could be saved. This is an example of {{c1::scarcity}}	Econ::Key_Concept Econ::Term::1::Week_2
	the Economic Problem	That there is a scarce and finite number of resources that must be used to satisfy unlimited and competing wants. Therefore, it is impossible to satisfy all wants. Therefore, in satisfying one, you forgo satisfying another.	You have five dollars, and you want a chocolate bar, at tea and a book, all costing five dollars.	In this example the five dollars is your resource and the three items are a want. If you say purchase the tea, therefore satisfying it, you are sacrificing the chance to satisfy the others.

{{c1::Elastic Demand}} means that quantity demanded has a&nbsp;{{c2::more than proportionate reaction}} to the price change.&nbsp;{{c3::Inelastic Demand means}} that demand will have a&nbsp;{{c4::less than proportionate}} reaction to the price change	Econ::Concept::1::Supply_and_Demand::Demand::Price_Elasticity_of_Demand
The aim of inflation is to have it in the inflation band between 2 to 3 percent {{c1::over the course of the business cycle}}	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation
Why is there a social justice imperative of avoiding high inflation?	"Because it's negative effects are felt most by the poor"	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation
Businesses will make their goods closer to needs,&nbsp;make it so it is difficult to switch,&nbsp;create points of difference,&nbsp;make a good habit forming/addictive. What are all of these focused on?	Making their goods have inelastic demand	Econ::Concept::1::Supply_and_Demand::Demand::Price_Elasticity_of_Demand::Inelastic
Businesses make their goods closer to needs, make it&nbsp; so it is difficult to switch, create points of difference, make a good habit forming/addictive. What are all of these based upon?	The five elasticity factors	Econ::Concept::1::Supply_and_Demand::Demand::Price_Elasticity_of_Demand::Inelastic
Name the five elasticity factors	"&nbsp;- whether a good is a luxury or a necessity<br>&nbsp;- whether a good has a close substitute<br>&nbsp;- the good's price as a proportion of income<br>&nbsp;- the length of time since a price change <br>&nbsp;- whether the good is habit forming/addictive"	Econ::Concept::1::Supply_and_Demand::Demand::Price_Elasticity_of_Demand::Elasticity_Factors
The three reasons why the poor are more heavily impacted by high inflation is because they are {{c1::impacted by the loss purchase power of money to a more significant extent,}} {{c2::they are less likely to get a wage rise,}} and {{c3::they are more likely to lose their job first in a recession, which the high inflation will likely trigger}}	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation
Why are the poor more heavily impacted by the loss of purchase power of money in a recession	Because they have less money to spend than the wealthy, both in savings and in earnings	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation
What are the four basic economic questions?	&nbsp;- What to Produce<br>&nbsp;- How much to Produce<br>&nbsp;- How to Produce<br>&nbsp;- How to Distribute	Econ::Concept::1::Four_Basic_Economic_Questions
For Whom to Produce	How to Distribute	Econ::Concept::1::Four_Basic_Economic_Questions::How_To_Distribute
If Aggregate Demand is to exceed the level of full employment, what will take place	An increase in inflation, with limited to no benefit to GDP	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Demand_Pull
Will there be a growth in output if the economic growth exceeds full employment?	No	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
Explain why any growth past the full employment point will not lead to an increase in output	Because the economy has exceeded its productive capacity - the economy does not have the ability to grow any further	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
Why is it vital to attempt to increase Aggregate Supply, instead of just focusing on increasing Aggregate Demand?	Because if the level of Aggregate Supply is not increased, then the economy will reach its full employment point eventually - and after exceeding this point any increase to aggregate demand will not equate to an increase in out	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
Output	GDP	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
What is the point of Full Employment known as, in terms of the level of output?	Potential GDP	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
Why is Full Employment also known as Potential GDP?	Because of the fact that it is the potential maximum productive capacity of the economy	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
Explain what will occur to both output and price level if the full employment point is exceeded	As the productive capacity has been exceeded, the level of output of the economy cannot be increased. Yet as demand is increasing, demand will rise in the form of demand push inflation. This therefore means that the price level will have risen	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
Explain why Aggregate Supply will dictate the level of output in the long term	Because if Aggregate Supply is unable to increase, then Aggregate Demand will reach the point of Full Employment, therefore meaning the level of output cannot increase in the future	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
When the government attempts to slow growth, what are they usually attempting to do?	Attempting to not have the economic growth exceed the level of full employment	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
GDP Gap	The gap between the macroeconomic equilibrium, and the level of full employment	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
Potential GDP	The Potential Maximum level of output, which will be at the point of Full Employment	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
In an ideal world, what would the government attempt to alter in order to achieve sustainable growth?	Increase the level of Aggregate Supply	Econ::Concept::2::Sustainable_Growth::Role_of_Government
Why, in an ideal world, would the government attempt to increase the level of aggregate supply in order to achieve sustainable economic growth?	Because that would mean that there is no need to attempt to slow Aggregate Demand	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply Econ::Concept::2::Sustainable_Growth::Role_of_Government
In the real world, what will the government do in order to attempt to achieve sustainable economic growth	Attempt to slow the growth of Aggregate Demand	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Demand Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply Econ::Concept::2::Sustainable_Growth::Role_of_Government
Why is it impractical for the government to attempt to increase the level of aggregate supply in order to attempt to achieve sustainable growth?	Because it takes a long period to increase Aggregate Supply, while the level of Aggregate Demand can be altered quickly	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply Econ::Concept::2::Sustainable_Growth::Role_of_Government
Why is it vital that the government continues to focus on increasing the level of Aggregate Supply throughout the future, in terms of ensuring economic prosperity into the future	Because it increases the amount of room that the economy has to grow	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply Econ::Concept::2::Sustainable_Growth::Role_of_Government
What will the government use in order to slow the level of Aggregate Demand, in order to control growth	Fiscal and Monetary Policy	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy Econ::Concept::2::Sustainable_Growth::Role_of_Government
The government will use fiscal and monetary policy to attempt to increase or decrease growth.

Why is a slowdown of Aggregate Demand of growth depicted as a decrease on a graph?	Because you cant really depict a slowdown on a static image	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Demand
Using the Axis below, draw a scenario in which the level of growth in aggregate demand has been slowed	"<img src=""Slowdown in Aggregate Demand.png"">"	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Demand
True or False - if the government has attempted to slow the level of growth in aggregate demand, and they are successful in doing so, the economic growth percentage will go negative	False	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Demand
True or False - the government has attempted to slow the level of growth in aggregate demand, but because the economy is still growing, the economic growth figure is expressed in a positive	True	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Demand
The Government has attempted to&nbsp;{{c1::slow economic growth,}} and therefore the economic growth figure, presuming that it goes to plan, will be&nbsp;{{c2::still a positive, but not as high as it was before}}&nbsp;	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Demand
Economic Growth was at 3 percent, now it is at 2 percent. The government has attempted to get it to this point, and it has been successful. What did the government try to do	Slow economic growth	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Demand

Does labour return income?	Yes - wages	Econ::Concept::1::Four_Factors_of_Production::Labour Econ::Concept::1::Four_Factors_of_Production::Returns
In terms of the full employment of labour, what point is considered to be full employment (not the percentage, but the theory behind the percentage!!)	The point at which the level of unemployment does lead to mass wages growth because of a tight labour market, leading to mass inflation	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
What is the acronym for the point of full employment which does not lead to mass inflation?	NAIRU	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
What does NAIRU stand for?	Non-accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
"Because of the fact that the government's view of what full employment for workers is is the point of&nbsp;{{c1::non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment,}} not the previous definition of full employment which was that&nbsp;{{c2::policy makers should pursue an employment strategy to get everyone employed,}} it means that governments pursue policies which&nbsp;{{c3::we allow for a level of unemployment to exist}} currently being&nbsp;{{c4::four percent}}"	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
What is the main reason that a lower unemployment rate will act as a increase to inflation	That there is scarcity in the market for workers, and therefore people can bid for wage rises	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
True of false - the current definition of full employment is that everyone who gets a job can find a job	False	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
When the RBA purses a policy of full employment, what does the full employment actually mean	The level of employment which means that wages growth dont get too strong that inflation spirals	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
What leads to inflation spiralling if unemployment gets below the level of full employment?	Because then the labour market becomes so tight that wages are bid up massively	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
A period of economic hardship will be associated with both&nbsp;{{c1::a fall in revenue}} and a&nbsp;{{c2::increase in demand for government services.}} Both of these combine to produce&nbsp;{{c3::big hits to the budget bottom line}}	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Expenditure::Periods_of_Hardship
What are the two reasons that economic hardships hits the budget bottom line?	That demand for government services increases and the revenue raised decreases	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Expenditure::Periods_of_Hardship
The reason why government revenue will be effected in a major way by periods of economic hardship is because&nbsp;{{c1::the taxes which the federal government derives the most revenue from,}} are&nbsp;{{c2::massively reliant on consumption staying strong}}	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Expenditure::Periods_of_Hardship
"Aggregate Supply won't just be effected by the quantity available of {{c2::factors of production and inputs}},&nbsp;{{c1::but also the prices of the factors of production and inputs,}} among other things"	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply
The government randomly decides to make petrol cost 10 dollars a litre, and there also wizards so the quantity of petrol shipped into Australia will not change. Will this effect aggregate supply?	Yes	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply
The government randomly decides to make petrol cost 10 dollars a litre, and there also wizards so the quantity of petrol shipped into Australia will not change. Explain why this counts as a decrease to aggregate supply, despite the quantity of the good staying flat	Because the changes to costs of doing businesses makes producing goods more expensive, so we can produce less - therefore decreasing aggregate supply	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply
Explain why changing costs of factors of productions or inputs will act to increase or decrease the level of aggregate supply	Because the cost that they are will to affect the quantity of goods and services which can be produced, affecting the level of aggregate supply	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply
What does it mean when there is spare capacity in the economy	That the full employment point has not been reached	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
"There's a lot of spare capacity in the economy, and the government wants to help grow the economy. Inflation is only at 1 percent. What can the government do to boost output and why?"	"Just increase aggregate demand, because full employment isn't met and inflation associated with it won't be a negative (if it causes it at all)"	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
Infrastructure allows for easier movement of goods, along with other things, so it is really hard to do business, so it can be considered part of&nbsp;{{c1::aggregate supply}}	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply

"Monetary Policy is defined as the use of the Reserve Bank of Australia's control over the {{c1::money supply}} (cost and availability of credit) to {{c2::influence aggregate demand}}"	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
Explain why Aggregate Supply must be increased into the future	If aggregate supply is not increased, then eventually the full employment point will be reached by Aggregate Demand - therefore failing to increase output and only mass inflation. Therefore, we must continue to increase Aggregate Supply as so we do not hit that ceeling. It also quells inflation	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply
"Monetary Policy is controlled by the&nbsp;{{c1::Reserve Bank}} in Australia, on behalf of&nbsp;{{c2::the Government.}} The point of monetary policy is to use the&nbsp;{{c3::Cash Rate}} to, {{c6::through the transition mechanism,}} {{c4::influence Aggregate Demand,}} in order to attempt to achieve the Reserve Bank's&nbsp;{{c5::Three Monetary Policy Goals}}"	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy

Can the Reserve Bank fulfil their monetary policy goals at the same time?	No	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
Which Full Employment strategy does the Reserve Bank currently hold - Traditional Full Employment or Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment?	NAIRU	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
"Why can't the reserve bank fulfil their goals at the same time?"	Because they are often mutually exclusive	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
Why does the Reserve Bank value the stability of the currency more than the other aims?	Because by fulfilling it the others can also be, at least partially be fulfilled. The same thing cannot be said of the other two	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
The reason why the Reserve Bank will attempt to values the goal of {{c1::Stability of the Currency}} more than the others is because {{c2::by fulfilling it the others can also be, at least partially be fulfilled.}} The {{c3::same thing cannot be said of the other two}}	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy

How does the Transmission Mechanism work?	The cash rate will act to effect other interest rates in the economy, as well as the exchange rate	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
Explain how, in relation to consumption and investment, the transmission mechanism acts to influence the rest of the economy	When the cash rate is altered, so will other interest rates. This will therefore act to incentivise or disincentivise borrowing and savings	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
The transmission mechanism will effect the amount of consumption and investment through&nbsp;{{c1::altering other interest rates in the economy,}} most prominently the interest rates for&nbsp;{{c2::savings and borrowing.}} This change will therefore act to influence both&nbsp;{{c3::consumption and investment::Ag Dem Component influenced}}	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
Which one is Monetary Policy more effective at doing - slowing or stimulating growth?	Slowing	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
Why is Monetary Policy more effective at slowing then stimulating growth?	Because when the cash rate pushed downwards it only incentivises spending and lending. When it is pushed upwards it acts to incentivise savings, but will actually act as barrier for lending to many due to the increased costs	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
Which components of Aggregate Demand does changing the cash rate influence?	Consumption, Investment and Net Exports	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism

Explain how a lower interest rates will increase net exports	It will decrease the value of our currency, so imports will have become more expensive, and exports will have become cheaper	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
Explain how a higher interest rates will decrease net exports	It will decrease the value of our currency, so imports will have become more cheaper, and exports will have become more expensive on the global market	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
How does the transmission mechanism work in terms of morgages and loans that have already been issued?	"It will act to make people's loan repayments either cheaper or more expensive"	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
How does the transmission mechanism effect aggregate demand, in terms of influencing home loans?	"Changing the cash rate will, through the transmission mechanism, act to increase or decrease people's repayment costs. This will therefore effect the level of disposable income that people have, therefore effecting consumption"	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
"There are {{c5::two::Don't Count!!}} parts to the transmission mechanism in regards to loans. The first is in regards to {{c4::new loans}} -&nbsp;{{c1::it will act to encourage or disencourage purchases of the loans because of lower or higher rates.}} The second is to do with {{c3::servicing current loans}} -&nbsp;{{c2::people will have to spend more or less on repayments, and therefore they will have different amounts of income, effecting consumption}}"	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
Which one will a <b>Higher</b> Interest Rate act to do - appreciate or deppreciate the value of the Australian Dollar	Appreciate	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
Which one will a <b>Lower&nbsp;</b>Interest Rate act to do - increase or decrease the value of the Australian Dollar	Decrease	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
When the Reserve Bank makes their decision on the cash rate, they will look at a lot of data.

What does it mean when the Reserve Bank has an expansionary stance?	That they are trying to use Monetary Policy to increase Aggregate Demand	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
What does it mean when the Reserve Bank has an contractionary stance?	That they are trying to use Monetary Policy to attempt to slow down Aggregate Demand	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
What does it mean when the Reserve Bank has an neutral stance?	That they are trying to use Monetary Policy to neither boost nor slow down Aggregate Demand	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
The Reserve Bank increases the cash rate to 0.25 percent. Does this mean that they have a contractionary stance?	"Likely not - it's likely they are just less expansionary than before"	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
Which one is associated with an expansionary stance - high or low interest rates 	Low	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Stances
Which one is associated with an contractionary stance - high or low interest rates 	High	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Stances
Is there a set rate of what is considered to be a neutral stance?	No	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Stances
What would make the point of neutral stance move around?	The state of the economy	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Stances
Why is it important for the Reserve Bank to know where a neutral stance is, apart from being able to go there when it dictates?	They need to know where it is so that if they are aware of how much of a kick up/down their current rate setting will require if they want to adopt one	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Stances
Explain what the monetary policy setting has been over the last five years	It has been expansionary, with the rate starting at 2 percent and then being cut downwards further and further, before being dropped to record lows due to covid	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy

Unemployment is at four percent, and the other factors of production are operating at their productive capacity - is full employment the full employment point met and why?	Yes - becuase the factors of production are their capacity, and as unemployment is at NAIRU, this is considered capacity for labour	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment Fll
True of false - full employment, in regards to labour currently, requires for labour to be at its productive capacity completely	False	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment Fll
True of false - full employment means the exact same thing for all the factors of productions&nbsp;	False	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment Fll
Which factor of production has a definition of full employment which differs compared to other factors of production, and why	Labour - because current economic policy is that there should be a level of unemployment which means that the labour market is not so tight that inflation takes off	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment Fll
Why is it that a increase in the value of the Australian Dollar decreases net exports?	Because through the increase in the value of the currency, imports will have become cheaper, so quantity demanded for them will expand, but the price of our exports will increase, so quantity demanded will contract. This means that the positive goes downwards, and the negative goes upwards	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
The reason that a decrease in the value of the currency will increase net exports is because through the decrease in the value of the currency, imports will have become {{c1::more expensive, so quantity demanded for them will contract,}} but the price of our exports will {{c2::decrease in price, so quantity demanded will expand.}} This means that the positive {{c3::(exports)}} goes {{c3::upwards}}, and the negative {{c4::(imports)}} goes {{c4::downwards}}	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
Which one do businesses want their goods/services to have, elastic or inelastic demand?	Inelastic Demand	Econ::Concept::1::Supply_and_Demand::Demand::Price_Elasticity_of_Demand
Why do businesses want their goods/services to have inelastic demand?	Because this therefore means that they can raise the price without a decrease in revenue<br>	Econ::Concept::1::Supply_and_Demand::Demand::Price_Elasticity_of_Demand
Fiscal and Monetary Policy both act to influence&nbsp;{{c1::aggregate demand}}	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
What is the point of microeconomic policy?	To try to increase the level of Aggregate Supply	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Microeconomic_Policy
Explain why increasing Aggregate Supply will help quell inflation	If we increase our productive capacity it means we can produce more goods. We also need less resources to do this. This therefore means that the inflationary pressures, inspired because of both shortages being created, and also the increasing costs of the factors of production, are both removed	
Microeconomic Policy	<div>a wide range of policies and government actions that aim to increase Productivity, which in tern increases the level of aggregate supply and therefore the longer term rate of economic growth.</div>	Econ::Concept::2::Productivity
"What does it mean that Gross Domestic Product only considers ""final goods and services""?"	It means that inputs and factors of productions are not included in the Gross Domestic Product figures	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
Are incomes from the factors of production included in the Gross Domestic Product figure?	No	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
Why are the income from factors of production not included in Gross Domestic Product?	Because the money earnt will be used in the purchase of goods, so you dont want to double count	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
What is the point of excluding factors of production and inputs from the Gross Domestic Product figure?	They are used in the production of goods and services, so not counting them avoiding double counting	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
Which one does economic growth use, Nominal or Real Gross Domestic Product and why?	"Real - because you don't want inflation making it look like the economy is growing"	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
That Gross Domestic Product is the value of goods produced in an economy means that&nbsp;{{c1::imports}} are excluded, but&nbsp;{{c2::domestically produced goods}} and&nbsp;{{c3::exports}} are included	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
Gross Domestic Product must be a&nbsp;{{c1::final good,}}&nbsp;{{c2::be produced in an economy,}} and&nbsp;{{c3::be a market good}}	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
inputs	intermediary goods	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
Market Good	a good that is being sold on the market	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
What does it mean that Gross Domestic Product only considers market goods?	That the good must be sold, it cant be things like unpaid labour	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
What is the main measure used to measure the performance of the economy by most economists?	Gross Domestic Product	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
The five main criticisms of Gross Domestic Product are that&nbsp;{{c1::it does not measure unpaid work,}}&nbsp;{{c2::it is not an actual measure of welfare,}}&nbsp;{{c3::it does not measure inequality,}} {{c4::it does not distinguish between reasons for purchase}} and&nbsp;{{c5::it does not measure what harm may being being done by the production of the goods or service}}	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
"Explain why paid labour is included in Gross Domestic Product, but wages aren't"	"Because paid labour isn't wages, it is a service that you are paid for"	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
True or false - because income, which includes wages, are not included in Gross Domestic Product, this means that paying for a cleaner also is not included	Fasle	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
"Explain why paying for a cleaner is included in Gross Domestic Product, despite the fact that wages aren't"	It is not the wage that you are paying here, but instead it is the service of the cleaner that you are paying for	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
Why are wages not included in Gross Domestic Product?	Because if they were it would cause double counting	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
Multiplier Effect	that an increase to any component of Aggregate Demand will have a multiplied effect on that amount in Gross Domestic Product&nbsp;	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Multiplier_Effect
Does the multiplier effect deal with just an increase in consumption?	No - once the money enters the economy it deals with consumption generated, but at first it can be from any component	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Multiplier_Effect
Explain why at first the multiplier effect can be caused by not just an increase to consumption, but instead an increase to any component of aggregate demand	Because all of the increases to these components are going to trigger an increases to income and consumption&nbsp;	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Multiplier_Effect
At first the multiplier effect is triggered by an increase to&nbsp;{{c1::any component of Aggregate Demand.}} It will then have a multiplied effect&nbsp;{{c2::on Gross Domestic Product::What the multiplied effect is on}} through causing an&nbsp;{{c3::increase in incomes,}} and therefore an&nbsp;{{c4::increase to consumption}}	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Multiplier_Effect
Explain how the multiplier effect works	The multiplier effect works through an increase to any component of Aggregate Demand triggering a rise in wages, which therefore triggers an increase in consumption which leads to a multiplied effect on the increase in Gross Domestic Product	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Multiplier_Effect
The Multiplier Effect is triggered by an&nbsp;{{c1::increase in any component of Aggregate Demand.}} The multiplied effect will be had on&nbsp;{{c2::Gross Domestic Product}}	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Multiplier_Effect
On what does the multiplier effect have its multiplied effect on?	Gross Domestic Product&nbsp;	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Multiplier_Effect
Why is the fact that Gross Domestic Product only takes into account market goods seen as a weakness?	Because it means that volunteer work and unpaid labour, which boost living standards and would be included if they were paid, are excluded	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product::Weaknesses
Is Gross Domestic Product a measure of welfare?	No, it was never supposed to be one, people just cooped it as such	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product::Weaknesses
Is Gross Domestic Product totally worthless as a measure of the welfare of the people?	No - it is linked to other factors which effect welfare	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product::Weaknesses
"While Gross Domestic Product is not an actual measure of the welfare of the people, it is linked to things which&nbsp;{{c1::effect people's welfare,}} like&nbsp;{{c2::life expectancy,}}&nbsp;{{c3::infant mortality,}} and the other&nbsp;{{c4::economic indicators,}} as well as&nbsp;{{c5::wage growth}}"	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product::Weaknesses
Gross Domestic Product wants to avoid double counting, so&nbsp;{{c1::income and inputs}} are excluded	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
Are exports included in Gross Domestic Product?	Yes	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
Why would including incomes cause double counting on Gross Domestic Product. Is it because that money will be spent by the person?	No - it is because that money that is acting as the income must have been collected through the purchase of a good or service	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
Why is it a negative that Gross Domestic Product does not take into account reasons for purchase seen as a negative?	The growth may have been for a negative reason, such as rebuilding from a natural disaster	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
Sustainable Economic Growth	When the economy is not growing to such an extent that the increases to aggregate demand are triggering mass inflation	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
The point of&nbsp;{{c1::sustainable economic growth}} is to make sure that the increases to {{c2::Aggregate Demand}} are not so fast that it is increasing at a significantly faster pace than&nbsp;{{c3::Aggregate Supply,}} as to trigger&nbsp;{{c4::mass inflation}}	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product
The sustainable growth amount is dictated in part by how the economy preformed in previously in the business cycle. This is because the previous phase of the cycle will dictate {{c1::how much spare capacity there is in the economy}}	
Spare Capacity	The current gap between output and full employment	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth
How is spare capacity linked to the previous phase of the business cycle?	The previous phase of the business cycle will effect how close Aggregate Demand is to the full employment point	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth
What truly decides the amount of sustainable economic growth?	How much spare capacity there is&nbsp;	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth
The two kinds of inflation are&nbsp;{{c1::demand pull}} and&nbsp;{{c2::cost push}}	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation
What kind of inflation is caused by an increase in the price of factors of production or inputs?	Cost Push	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Aggregate_Supply Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push
The multiplier effect works through an increase to any component of Aggregate Demand triggering a rise in incomes, which therefore triggers an increase in consumption which then cycle. This then&nbsp;{{c1::leads to a multiplied effect on the increase in Gross Domestic Product}}	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Multiplier_Effect
Why has monetary policy had a significant expansionary stance over the last five years?	Because the fiscal policy has had a contractionary stance over the last five years in an attempt to regain a budget surplus. This was despite the economy not doing well. Therefore, monetary policy was left on its own trying to stimulate growth	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Stance Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Stance
What type of inflation is caused when the prices are being bid up by excess aggregate demand?	Demand Pull	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Demand_Pull
Globalisaiton	The increased level of co-operation between nation states, including economic matters	Econ::Concept::3::Globalisation
Globalisation is one of the most major changes in the economy in recent years, and therefore it will have some of the most significant&nbsp;{{c1::opportunity costs,}} but also&nbsp;{{c2::benefits}}	Econ::Concept::3::Globalisation
What does the fact that globalisation is a fundamental structural change in the economy mean in terms of impact?	That it will have stark opportunity costs, and also quite high benefits	Econ::Concept::3::Globalisation
Why is globalisation going to have such major opportunity costs and benefits?	Because it is a fundamental restructuring of the economy, both at the macro and micro level.	Econ::Concept::3::Globalisation
Some of the benefits of increased globalisation are&nbsp;{{c1::further trade,}}&nbsp;{{c2::Further Investment,}}&nbsp;{{c3::Multilateral co-operation}} and&nbsp;{{c4::the creation of Transnational and Mutlinational companies}}	Econ::Concept::3::Globalisation

What would the effect of removing a tariff be on domestic supply?	The price will fall and therefore domestic supply will contract	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Tarrifs
Why is the price of a good guaranteed to fall with the removal of a tariff?	Because if domestic suppliers were able to produce it at a lower price through innovation, then a domestic supplier would have bid down the price already	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Tarrifs
If domestic supply contract while domestic demand expands with the removal of a tariff, then where has the extra supply come from?	Imports	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Tarrifs

"Which country should produce computers and why?<br><img src=""paste-ea5592710e38c5e5976e9e3485869e8b88232fa5.jpg"">"	Vietnam, as their real cost of specialising in computers (0.25) is lower than Australia (0.4)	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
Can you figure out which option has the higher real cost by just looking at which option would result in the most total units?	No; because this does not actually tell you how many units of production are lost, it just tell you the amount of goods lost in totality	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
How do you figure out which country has comparative advantage?	You compare the two countries and see which one has the lowest opportunity costs in producing that good or service	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
Is this correct - you can figure out the amount of comparative advantage by examining which of the two options has the lower opportunity cost	No - look at which country had the lower opportunity cost of that particular good	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
Comparative Advantage	that we may maximise the utility of resources through specialisation in the production of the good or service with the lowest opportunity cost	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
What is the key thing to use as a mindset when thinking about comparative advantage?	You are not considering how much you gain, but instead how much you lose (the opportunity cost)&nbsp;	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
When we adopt the concept of comparative advantage and therefore specialise, we are going to gain an excess. What do we do with that excess?	We Export it	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
When we adopt the concept of comparative advantage and therefore specialise, we are going to lose that other good or service. How do we gain it?	We Import it	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
Is it possible for comparative advantage to exist without trade?	"No, because if we specialise we need to import that want that we're giving up"	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
Explain how the concept of Comparative Advantage allows for both countries to foster	When we adopt the concept we are focusing on using the resources for the want which is most effective. The country then exports the excess that they gain, and imports the good that they lose	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
Comparative Advantage only works if the countries are willing to&nbsp;{{c1::export the excess and import the lost production}}	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
Comparative Advantage is about&nbsp;{{c1::focusing on the production of goods and services with the lowest opportunity cost,}} as so we are&nbsp;{{c2::getting the maximum possible utility out o our resources}}	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
"You can think of Comparative Advantage as focusing on the thing that we're least worst at&nbsp;{{c1::when compared to the other country}}"	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
When a question asks about how free trade could create economic gain, one thing that you could discuss is&nbsp;{{c1::Comparative Advantage}}	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
How does Free Trade allow for comparative advantage?	Free Trade allows for comparative advantage because without it we would have to be self-sufficient and we would be unable therefore to specialise in the option with the lowest opportunity costs, meaning that our resources would have to be used on ineffective options	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Free_Trade
Free Trade allows for comparative advantage because {{c1::without it we would have to be self-sufficient}} and we would be unable therefore to {{c2::specialise in the option with the lowest opportunity costs}}, meaning that our {{c3::resources would have to be used on ineffective options}}	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Free_Trade
Some of the positives of free trade include that&nbsp;{{c1::we specialise in line with Comparative Advantage, focusing on what we are good at,}}&nbsp;{{c2::That Economies of Scales of increased sales means that fixed costs of business are spread over many different services, lowering cost}} COMPLETE THIS	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Free_Trade
Creative Destruction	That through the destruction of inefficient outdated business we are able to redeploy the resources and factors of production used on that business for a a more efficient and new purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Protectionism::The_Negatives
Why does protectionism mean that we miss out on creative destruction?	Because it means that these inefficient businesses are able to survive, and therefore we cant redploy their resources for more efficient uses, meaning we miss out on new innovative businesses	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Protectionism::The_Negatives
The lack of Creative Destruction from the implementation of protectionist policies means that we miss our on these resources being redeployed and therefore&nbsp;{{c1::we miss out on new innovative businesses}}	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Protectionism::The_Negatives
Why is the fact that we miss out on creative destruction seen as a negative of protectionism?	Because it means that the resources are not deployed and therefore we miss out on new or innovative businesses	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Protectionism::The_Negatives
Some of the negatives associated with protectionist policies include&nbsp;{{c1::the shielding of busineses disencourages innovation,}}&nbsp;{{c2::it means that we dont get to have creative destruction,}}&nbsp;{{c3::it may result in retaliatory measures that will hurt our exporters,}}&nbsp;{{c4::it may result in higher prices for consumers,}}&nbsp;{{c5::it does not allow us to specialise}}	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Protectionism::The_Negatives
Why is it a negative for us that shielding businesses from competition leads to a lack of innovation?	It means that we miss out on the positives of innovation; cheaper goods, better goods and less wasted resources	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Protectionism::The_Negatives
"The main negatives of shielding businesses from competition are&nbsp;{{c1::they dont need to innovate,}} {{c2::there's no creative destruction, so our resources are used ineffectively}} and&nbsp;{{c3::the lack of competiton inspires higher prices}}"	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Protectionism::The_Negatives
A Subsidy means that the government must pay a costly amount of money to the producer, this therefore means that the impact on the people will either be&nbsp;{{c1::higher taxes,}}&nbsp;{{c2::lower government services in other areas}}&nbsp;{{c3::more debt, which acts as a drag on future growth}}	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Protectionism::The_Negatives
"Why might a subsidy on an import competing industry lessen a governments' ability to respond to a recession?"	Because if they do it to a lot of industries it may result in massive deficits, and therefore the government may be unable to borrow and therefore spend more during the downturn	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Protectionism::The_Negatives
Subsidies cost a lot. Why is this a negative for people?	Because it means that there will either be one, a mix or all of higher taxes, lower government services and higher debt&nbsp;	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Protectionism::The_Negatives
If there is unsustainable growth, this will mean that Demand Push inflation,&nbsp;{{c1::in which the inability to produce more goods and services lead to mass inflation,}} will take hold	Econ::Concept::2::Sustainable_Growth
For there to be unsustainable growth, what must be occurring?	Growth must be increasing to such an extent that it will pass full employment and trigger significant demand push inflation	Econ::Concept::2::Sustainable_Growth
One of the major negatives of a expansionary monetary policy is that it usually equates to low cash rate. This means that initial borrowing rates on loans will be lower.&nbsp;However, this will have the impact that poor people get loans, and therefore when the cash rate increases&nbsp;{{c1::the debt servicing burden}} will increase, and therefore they may be crushed under debt&nbsp;	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
Debt Servicing Burden	The cost of servicing debt	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
Removing the concept of NAIRU, why would the Reserve Bank consider unemployment to have been eradicated at a point?	Because some of that is structural and no that cannot be solved by hospitable monetary policy	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
Why does free trade allow for the concept of Economies of Scale to kick in?	Because it means that companies are able to sell their goods and services to the international market, not just the domestic one, therefore increasing quantity sold	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Free_Trade::Economies_of_Scale
What are some fixed costs of doing business?	Product Innovation, and rental of factory space	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Free_Trade::Economies_of_Scale
Economies of Scale	that through having higher quantity each unit cost can be lower as the fixed costs of business are spread over more units	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Free_Trade::Economies_of_Scale
What are the two main automatic stabilisers in Australia	- Progressive Tax System<br>- Transfer of Payments	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Automatic_Stabalisers
"The&nbsp;{{c1::two::Don't Count!!}} Automatic Stabilisers in Australia are&nbsp;{{c2::Progressive Income Tax System}} and&nbsp;{{c3::Transfer of Payments}}"	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Automatic_Stabalisers
Automatic Stabilisers	a part of the budget that operates automatically in a counter cyclical manner to stablise fluctuations in Aggregate Demand	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Automatic_Stabalisers
What does it mean when it is said that automatic stabilisers are counter cyclical?	It means that they work against the business cycle	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Automatic_Stabalisers
Automatic Stabilisers work against the business cycle, so they are&nbsp;{{c1::counter cyclical}}	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Automatic_Stabalisers
Automatic Stabilisers are counter-cyclical so they&nbsp;{{c1::act to restrain high growth,}} and act to&nbsp;{{c2::boost low or negative growth}}	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Automatic_Stabalisers
How does the Progressive Tax System act as an automatic stabiliser?	Individuals will move between the different brackets of income and therefore they will be taxed less when they earn less, or be taxed more when they earn less	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Automatic_Stabalisers
Why would a regressive or progreissve tax not work as an automatic stabiliser	Because it would mean that individuals would be taxed either at the same amount or more	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Automatic_Stabalisers
Explain how in a high growth scenario the progressive income tax system acts to restrain growth	Individuals will earn more however as their income increases their income begins to enter new brackets. That means that that income is taxed at a higher rate and therefore individuals have less to spend than if there was no tax or a regressive or proportionate one. This therefore acts to restrain consumption and therefore growth	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Automatic_Stabalisers
Explain how in a low growth scenario the progressive income tax system acts to boost growth	Individuals will earn less however as their income decrease their income drops below the brackets. That means that that income is taxed at a lower rate and therefore individuals have more to spend than if there was no tax or a regressive or proportionate one. This therefore acts to boost consumption and therefore growth	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Automatic_Stabalisers
The&nbsp;{{c1::Progressive Tax System}} works as an Automatic Stabiliser because it acts to&nbsp;{{c2::either tax more than before in a scenario with high incomes, or tax less in a low income scenario.}} This therefore means that&nbsp;{{c3::it behaves in a counter cyclical way; either restraning or boosting consumption}}	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Automatic_Stabalisers
What do Automatic Stabilisers act to do to Aggregate Demand?	They act to stabilise its fluctuations	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Automatic_Stabalisers
Automatic Stabilisers act to {{c1::offset}} the decreases or increases in Aggregate Demand, as to control&nbsp;{{c2::fluctuations of too high or too low growth}}	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Fiscal_Policy::Automatic_Stabalisers
How much has the price of shipping to Australia from China increased since 2019?	250 Percent	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Current_Developments
Some of the reasons for the increases in the costs of imported goods and services are {{c2::the increased cost of shipping,}} an {{c1::the increasing price of energy}} and {{c3::lockdowns triggering a contraction in production,}}&nbsp;{{c4::decreases in volume of shipping last year due to incorrect expectations,}}&nbsp;{{c5::bottlenecks,}}&nbsp;{{c6::increases in demand,}} and {{c7::differing factors like increases in specific inputs like semiconductors and iron}}	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Current_Developments
The main reasons behind the increasing cost of shipping are&nbsp;{{c1::increased demand,}}&nbsp;{{c2::incorrect expectations of trade behaviour last year triggering 11 percent of the world shipping stock to be stored,}}&nbsp;{{c3::bottlenecks and backlogs,}}&nbsp;{{c4::decrease in airfreight due to a decrease in passenger travel,}}&nbsp;{{c5::displacement globally of shipping crates}} and&nbsp;{{c6::bottlenecks at ports}}	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Current_Developments
How was the WTO wrong about trade last year?	They expected it to contract even in the most optimistic scenarios to be below 2019 levels in 2023 but instead it went to level in september and exceeded by january	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Current_Developments
How did the wrong expectations of global trade impact the shipping industry	They removed 11 percent of global shipping however when demand actually expanded the realisation was too late and it took until july 2021 for shipping to return to near 2020 level	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Current_Developments
Shipping was expected to contract but it expanded, so it created&nbsp;{{c1::the wrong expectations and led to shipping cancellations}}	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Current_Developments
The increased costs of shipping are being driven by two main factors,&nbsp;{{c1::coal}} and&nbsp;{{c2::natural gas}}	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Current_Developments
India usually has 14 days of coal stockpiled, however they had only&nbsp;{{c1::4}} during the energy crisis	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Current_Developments
A lower or higher cash rate will have an effect on loans. It will {{c1::make it more expensive to borrow,}} and&nbsp;{{c2::make it impossible to borrow if the rate means that individuals are banned from borrowing, under APRA rules.}}&nbsp;	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy::Cash_Rate::Transmission_Mechinism
Why is it that protectionism results in less innovation?	Because we are shielding these businesses from competition, and therefore there is no drive to outcompete a competitor	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Protectionism::The_Negatives
Where does Total Spending come from?	Total Spending comes from Consumers firms and governments	Econ::Concept::2::The_Totals::Total_Spending
When there is spare capacity in the economy, it means that&nbsp;{{c1::the factors of production are not at their full capacity}} and therefore&nbsp;{{c2::Full Employment has not been reached}}	Econ::Concept::2::Aggregate_Demand_and_Supply::Full_Employment
Why is the fact that with protectionism means you cannot specialise seen as a negative?	Because it means that we must waste our scare and finite resources on ineffecive uses, and therefore we are unable to increase our material wealth	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Free_Trade::Specilisation Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Protectionism::The_Negatives
Why would the reserve bank not consider structural unemployment when discussing employment	Because having a flexible hiring market really isnt going to help them out, so the Reserve Bank cant do anything	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
"What's the kind of inflation that is associated with rising prices of factors of production or inputs"	Cost Push	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push
Has there been any clear cases of divestment from Australian Capital because of a lack of climate action?	Yes, the Riksbank in Sweeden divested from Queensland and West Australian Bond	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Global_Conditions
What is our biggest exports?	Resource Commodities	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Our_Trade
What is the effect of a majority of our exports being comprised off of Resource Commodities?	As they fluctuate frequently and sharply both price and quantity demanded our exchange rate therefore in tern frequently fluctuates	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Our_Trade
The fact that we have a&nbsp;{{c1::narrow export base,}} of which a large percentage is&nbsp;{{c2::comprised off of Resource Commodities,}} means that our exchange rate {{c3::frequently fluctuates,}} as commodity {{c5::prices as well as the quantity demanded}} are&nbsp;{{c4::volatile}}	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Our_Trade
Cost Push Inflation	The inflation caused by the increases in the costs of production, mainly increases in the price of factors of production and inputs	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push
What is the main thing which has caused cost push inflation before?	An Increase in the price of fuel	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push
Why is Cost Push inflation worse than Demand Pull Inflation	Because with Cost Push we are at least getting more or the same level of stuff as before. This is while Cost Push means we are getting less output, yet more expensive goods	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Demand_Pull
Why would Cost Push Inflation result in an increase in the amount of unemployment?	It is not the inflation itself, but instead the decrease in Aggregate Supply and therefore output	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push

Demand Pull Inflation	When excess aggregate demand leads to inflation	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Demand_Pull
Why does Demand Pull Inflation occur at a greater level once the full employment point has been exceeded?	Because past this point we are unable to use our factors of production any further, and therefore our ability to produce more goods and services is extremely limited	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Demand_Pull
What does any further demand result in past the point of full employment?	Severe Demand Pull Inflation	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Demand_Pull
"There are {{c1::two::Don't Count!!!}} main ways in which we can increase Aggregate Supply. These are&nbsp;{{c2::increasing the total level,}} and {{c3::increase productivity}}"	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Demand_Pull
How can we avoid Demand Pull Inflation	Attempting to have sustainable levels of growth, as well as increasing Aggregate Supply, either through increases or allowing the markets to operate more efficiently	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Demand_Pull
"The {{c1::two::Don't Count!!!}} ways in which we can avoid&nbsp;{{c2::Demand Pull Inflation}} are&nbsp;{{c3::through maintaining sustainable levels of growth}} as well as&nbsp;{{c4::through increasing the total level of Aggregate Supply both through more of it and allowing for markets to operate more efficiently through microeconomic reform}}"	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Demand_Pull
How do we end Cost Push Inflation?	Through decreasing Aggregate Demand	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push
Some examples of causes of Cost Push inflation include&nbsp;{{c1::increases in wages,}}&nbsp;{{c2::increases in the price of fuel}} and&nbsp;{{c3::natural disasters decreasing the number of factor of productions and inputs}}	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push
There has been a natural disaster. Explain the effect on supply, and which supply factor has caused this?	Decrease - Change in the State of Technology	Econ::Concept::1::Supply_and_Demand::Supply::Supply_Factors
"When its said that theres been a ""shock"" to the economy, what type of inflation is being discussed?"	Cost Push	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push
Explain why Cost Push Inflation may result in a recession instantly?	Because, the cause of Cost Push - the fall in Aggregate Supply - also means that output has fallen, and therefore Gross Domestic Product is hit	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push
To slow or stop Cost Push Inflation, we must slow or decrease&nbsp;{{c1::Aggregate Demand.}} This therefore means that the&nbsp;{{c2::recesionarry pressures}} which have been created by {{c6::the decrease in Aggregate Supply}} are&nbsp;{{c3::compounded,}} deepening the&nbsp;{{c4::recession}} as well as the&nbsp;{{c5::negative like unemployment associated with it}}	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push
Does a recession always equate to a fall in inflation?	"No, especially if there's Cost Push Inflation occurring. However usually it does equate to less inflation"	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Recession
Why is cost push inflation sometimes referred to as a shock?	Because usually it has an unexpected cause like a sudden rise in oil or a natural disaster	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push
What has Unemployment been doing the recently?	Declining slightly with exception of October, though the number of worked hours and employed people declined, with both metrics below pre-pandemic levels	Econ::Concept::2::Unemployment::Current_Trends
What is meant by businesses hoarding workers?	Businesses are keeping workers on on zero hours, as so that they can quickly snap them onto rolls after lockdown ends	Econ::Concept::2::Unemployment::Current_Trends
What is the positive of hoarding of workers?	The positives are that businesses expect that once lockdown ends they will be able to snap these people on, and the number of job ads as well as business confidence data suggests that they will be able to do this,	Econ::Concept::2::Unemployment::Current_Trends
What are the negative of the hoarding worker&nbsp;	The Negative is that these people are currently earning no wages, and therefore are essentially unemployed yet not counted as it	Econ::Concept::2::Unemployment::Current_Trends

It means that we are able to produce more goods and services at a lower prices, and also, theoretically, should lead to higher wages through the decreases in the other costs to the businesses	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Microeconomic_Policy
Why does microeconomic policy make Australia more internationally competitive?	It means that they can produce their goods at lower prices, and therefore they will be more attractive	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Microeconomic_Policy

Why is it that Unemployment dropped in the first three months of lockdown in Victoria, New South Wales, and the ACT?	Because of a drop in the participation rate and because&nbsp; businesses were hoarding their workers on zero hours has so when a reopening occurred they could be quickly put back on staff, therefore not allowing to be counted as unemployed	Econ::Concept::2::Unemployment
When we use comparative advantage, we will gain a&nbsp;{{c1::surplus.}} We then&nbsp;{{c2::export the surplus.}} We then&nbsp;{{c3::import}} the&nbsp;{{c4::good or service that we lose through specialisation, which the other nation has specialised in.}}	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Free_Trade
Who does quantitative easing?	Central Banks	Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy
Over the last five years the Reserve Bank has used monetary policy in a highly expansionary manner.

The poor have a&nbsp;{{c1::lower}} propensity to save	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Multiplier_Effect
What does it mean that the poor have a lower propensity to save than the wealthy?	It means that they will spend a greater proportion of the money that they receive and therefore the multiplier effect is boosted	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Multiplier_Effect
Most of the government stimulus in 2020 was focused on the poor through things like JobKeeper and increases in different benefit payments.

Why does the Exchange Rate influence the economy as a whole?	As it will dictate the price of many inputs, as well as the quantity that is exported. This therefore influences total output and therefore employment, and therefore total income and inflation	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates
The exchange rate is critical in the&nbsp;{{c1::macroeconomic picture}} of Australia because it will influence&nbsp;{{c2::imports, specially the price of inputs, and the quantity of exports,}} {{c6::therefore influencing both Aggregate Demand and Supply.}}This therefore has&nbsp;{{c3::flow on effects}} to&nbsp;{{c4::GDP}} and therefore&nbsp;{{c5::Employment and Inflation}}	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates
What are the characteristics of a shock?	An event which triggers a decrease in Aggregate Supply which therefore both increases the price level through Cost Push inflation and decreases output	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push
Explain why a significant depreciation in the the currency could trigger a shock	A significant depreciation in the currency means that costs of critical inputs would increase, which would therefore trigger a decrease in Aggregate Supply	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Cost_Push Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates
Explain why changes in the exchange rate of the currency have both a direct and indirect effect on Inflation	Directly it influences the price of final goods and services we import. Indirectly it influences the cost of inputs, which therefore influences the costs of domestically produced goods and services. This acts to flow on to the labour market, which is also influenced by the changes to Aggregate Demand	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates
Explain the relationship between Exchange Rates and Employment	It will influence the costs of inputs that we import, which therefore influences Aggregate Supply and also influences Aggregate Demand&nbsp;	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates
Explain the direct effect that a change in the exchange rate will have on inflation	It will influence the cost of the goods and services that we import, and influence the total amount of Aggregate Demand	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates
Explain the indirect effects that a change in the exchange rate will have on inflation	It will mean that the costs of inputs will change, and therefore influence Aggregate Supply. This will be furthered by the effects had on investment. The change will influence Aggregate Demand which will therefore effect employment, and therefore inflation	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates
What are some examples of where there could be a tragedy of the commons?	Radio Waves and Fisheries	Econ::Concept::1::Market_Failure::Common_Resources
Explain how Gross Domestic Product would influence employment	More or less production will mean more or less employment	Econ::Concept::2::Gross_Domestic_Product Econ::Concept::2::Unemployment

Explain how Demand Pull inflation occurs?	Excess Aggregate Demand bids up the prices of goods and services	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Demand_Pull
Why does Demand Pull inflation worsen the closer we get to the full employment point?	Because businesses will begin to struggle to increase their output, and therefore they will be unable to produce more goods and services	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation::Demand_Pull
Comparative advantage allows us to boost productivity it means that we are using our inputs more effectively, {{c1::and therefore we are able to produce a greater amount of outputs.}} We are also able to redistribute {{c2::the resources to new purpouses}}	Econ::Concept::3::Comparative_Advantage
True or False - the multiplier effect only works as a postive	False	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Multiplier_Effect
The Multiplier Effect holds that any increase in Aggregate Demand will have a multiplied effect on Gross Domestic Product. This works in the positive, but also in the&nbsp;{{c1::negative}}	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Multiplier_Effect
The Government announces that they are cutting welfare by 2 billion dollars. Does this mean that there is only that two billion dollar hit to Gross Domestic Product.	No - because the multiplier effect works in reverse as well	Econ::Concept::2::Economic_Growth::Multiplier_Effect

Australia has recorded trade surpluses many times between 1975 and 2019, yet the current account never entered a surplus. Why?	Because the structural debt in the Net Primary Income outweighed the trade surpluses experienced in the Balance on Goods and Services	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Current_Account
What has been the recent trend in Balance on Goods and Services&nbsp;	"Has been recording surpluses since 2018, with record surpluses being recorded in 2021, mainly being driven by both higher demand and prices for Australia's Resource Commodities"	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Current_Account
True or False - Australia is recording a record surplus, so that means that the amount of imports must have decreased	False	Econ::Concept::3::Trade::Imports

Why might the Reserve Bank not be concerned with inflation above the target band for a short duration?	Because it is a soft target and because it was below the target band for so long, and therefore they may let it run above the target if the expansionary monetary policy solidified low unemployment	Econ::Concept::2::Inflation Econ::Concept::2::Policies::Monetary_Policy

Why does a floating exchange rate allow us to exit a Current Account Deficit more easily, presuming that the deficit is being caused by Balance on Goods and Services	Because the greater supply of the Australian Dollar caused by the increase in purchases of imports will depreciate the dollar, making imports unattractive domestically while making our exports more attractive internationally	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Current_Account Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates::Factors

The Current Account Deficit will have two effects on the exchange rate. Firstly, if&nbsp;{{c1::there is a deficit being caused by a Balance on Goods and Services then it has a offsetting effect as the currency begins to depreciate,}} and secondly&nbsp;{{c2::there is a risk that with significant foreign liabilities there could be a sudden pullout which triggers a massive depreciation in the currency}}	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Current_Account::Current_Account_Deficit Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates

A {{c2::appreciation}} in the dollar will make our importing {{c1::more competitive}}	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Current_Account Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates
What is the way in which all businesses may feel positives from an appreciation in the dollar?	That the decreased costs of imports will mean that consumers will have more money to consume on different goods and services	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates::The_Effect
How are importing firms going to be effected from an appreciated dollar?	Their inputs or the goods that they sell are going to be cheaper to purchase, so their profits will increase or they can pass the lower costs onto consumers and have demand expand	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates::The_Effect::Appreciation
How will import competing firms be effected by an appreciation in the dollar?	They will be hurt, as the appreciation will mean that they are less competitive than before	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates::The_Effect::Appreciation
True or False - companies like resource commodity miners will see their competitiveness decrease when there is an appreciation in the Dollar	False - all these miners are always paid in United States Dollars, so their competitiveness will not decrease, though they will see their profits fall	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates::The_Effect::Appreciation
"A company like a resource miner won't see their competitiveness decrease by an appreciation in the dollar, but they will be hurt, why?"	Because with the appreciation this means that the united states dollar must have depreciated in comparison, so their profits will decrease compared with previous	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates::The_Effect::Appreciation
"Why can't a company like a resource commodity miner just keep their holdings in United States Dollars until the dollar depreciates?"	Because they need to pay some people in Australian Dollars like dividends and wages	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates::The_Effect::Appreciation
An appreciation in the dollar will make our exports less competitive. Companies which are paid in Australian Dollars - like tourism operators and manufacturers - will be hurt because they will&nbsp;{{c1::become less competitive, and therefore they will either need to decrease their prices or charge a premium, both hitting revenue.}} Producers who are paid in United States Dollars will see their&nbsp;{{c2::competitiveness stay the same but their revenue decrease as the depreciated United States Dollar means they are earning less Australian Dollars than before}}	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates::The_Effect::Appreciation

Valuation Effects	The effect that a change in the exchange rate will alter the amount owed on the principal	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates::The_Effect::Appreciation
What will the effect on those with foreign debt be by the appreciation of the dollar?	A positive - because Valuation Effects means that they will have to pay less	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates::The_Effect::Appreciation
Why does having an higher exchange rate differential mean that both the demand and supply are hit? Explain using a scenario in which we have a higher currency differential	There will be more capital inflows as there are more profits to be had, increasing demand, and at the same time investment already here will stay here and sell less than they did before, decreasing supply	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates::Factors
Explain how the interest rate differential works, in a scenario with lower rates than the rest of the world	In this scenario, this would mean that there are more attractive investment opportunities overseas. We would therefore see the demand for the australian dollar fall, as investment beings to decrease, and also see a rise in the supply, as current investment in the country begins to leave as to invest in more profitable markets, as well as Australians investing in foreign opportunities. We would therefore see these forces combine to depreciate the currency	Econ::Concept::3::Exchange_Rates::Factors

Portfolio Investment	Investment for the sake of turning a quick profit	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Capital_and_Financial_Account
Direct investment	Investment which is made in order for the establishment of a new enterprise, or for the purpose of gaining a controlling stake in an already existing enterprise	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Capital_and_Financial_Account
Why do we prefer Direct investment to Portfolio Investment	Because Direct Investment is made in order to create or help boost enterprise, therefore helping the economy, while portfolio investment is more in things like shares for a quick profit. Direct Investment is also not going to flee	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Capital_and_Financial_Account

Why would have low global interest rates acted to have decreased the deficit on the net primary income account?	Because it means that repayment costs on debt would have decreased, and the profits on investment will have fallen	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Current_Account::Current_Account_Deficit
Why does a Current Account Deficit have a habit of compounding?	Because the increases in foreign investment mean that the ourflows in the Net Primary Income Account have a habit of compounding	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Current_Account::Current_Account_Deficit
Why could the Current Account Deficit increase the level of volatility in the Exchange Rate?	Because it makes investors more weary of Australian investment so investment begins to become more volatile	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Current_Account::Current_Account_Deficit
Why would a high Current Account Deficit risk future investment?	Because it may mean that investors see as us too risky, and therefore refuse to invest, decreasing investment	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Current_Account::Current_Account_Deficit

When the world price is above our domestic equilibrium, what will we do with that product?	We will export it	Econ::Concept::3::Trade
Explain why when the world price is below the domestic equilibrium we would be importing the product?	Because it means that the world can produce that good or service at a lower price, so we can get it for cheaper from overseas	Econ::Concept::3::Trade
Explain why we would export the good or service if the world price was higher than the domestic equilibrium	Because it means we can produce the good efficiently enough that more profits can be have overseas, and therefore our suppliers would export the good or service	Econ::Concept::3::Trade

What is the effect on a depreciation in the currency on the net primary income account?	The deficit will widen as individuals will be required to buy more foreign currency as to send the money, though this will in part be counteracted by an increase in incomes to those with inflowing money	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Current_Account::Current_Account_Deficit
Why would a currency depreciation mean that those with inflowing money get more than before?	Because the payments which are received in the foreign currency will buy more Australian Dollars than before	Econ::Concept::3::Balance_of_Payments::Current_Account::Current_Account_Deficit
