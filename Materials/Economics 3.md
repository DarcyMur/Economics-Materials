## Why GitHub?
Github better handles changes to files then, say, a Google Doc that is in read only mode, or a blog. The other advantage of this over a google doc is that it is adaptive to the screen, so it won't be difficult to see on a phone, and you are able to easily zoom in if the text is too small.
