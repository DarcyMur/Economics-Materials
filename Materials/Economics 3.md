*Note - on a number of the cards, specially in Unit 1, the cards are designed for you to draw on them as to get a practise with drawing things like Demand/Supply curves exc, I would recommend downloading [this application for windows](https://github.com/geovens/gInk) which will enable you to easily draw on the cards*

## Why GitHub?
Github better handles changes to files then, say, a Google Doc that is in read only mode, or a blog. The other advantage of this over a google doc is that it is adaptive to the screen, so it won't be difficult to see on a phone, and you are able to easily zoom in if the text is too small.
